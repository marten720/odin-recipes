        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>What have you been making the most during quarantine? I see many people have been baking sourdough, which to be honest I can't wait to start as soon as my starter is strong. But in the meantime, what I’ve been baking at least twice a week is pizza. I’ve simply become smitten with it. And after trying different methods, I finally came across the best pizza recipe. It come es via Roberta’s Pizza in Brooklyn, and it’s simply fantastic. The dough itself, is thin and pliant, tender and chewy. Most of all, it’s extraordinarily flavourful, and will last in the refrigerator for up to a week. So before we get started, there’s a few elements that need to be in place in order to set you for pizza success.</p>
        <p>There are a few tools that will ensure the pizza making process is an easy one, and like with anything you bake, the measurements need to be accurate.  These are the tools I have at home and all of them are affordable.</p>
        <p>I couldn't stress enough how important a scale is. When it comes to baking pizza, you want to measure your flour in grams. Using a measuring cup will more than likely, end up by having more flour in your recipe than what its called for. If you don’t have one yet, I would seriously consider ordering one online. They range in price, but go as low as $10.00. If you want to try this recipe and don’t have one at home, spoon the flour into the measuring cup and level it with a knife.</p>
        <p>When I first started baking pizzas, I bought a pizza stone. Within a few years, I had to keep replacing them. You see, to make sure your pizza dough cooks evenly and fast, the oven hast be heating for an hour at its highest temperature (usually 500 F or 550 F) before baking the pizza. The problem with a pizza stone is that it can’t simply withstand that amount of heat, and after a few uses it will break. So I decided to invest in a durable baking steel instead. Not only it will last you a lifetime, but it has a much greater thermal conductivity as well. Meaning that it retains heat more evenly and for longer than a baking stone does, and cooks the pizza faster and more effectively.  On top of that, you can also use the baking steel to bake rustic breads. Mine is from Baking Steel and you can find the one I have here.</p>
        <p>A must to transfer your pizza to and from the oven. Again, they range in price. I have a wooden one that has lasted for years and was not expensive.</p>
        <p>These tools will make the process of baking the best pizza recipe, simple and stress free. And believe me when I tell you, it's worth it.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>3 tbsp extra- virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, finely minced</li>
            <li>1 can (398 mL)  finely chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>Pinch of sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped</li>
            <li>153 grams 00 flour (1 cup plus 1 tablespoon)</li>
            <li>153 grams all-purpose flour (1 cup and 2 teaspoons)</li>
            <li>8 grams (1 teaspoon) sea salt</li>
            <li>2 grams (3/4 teaspoon) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>4 grams extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Cheese. Lots and lots of cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small pot, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and stir constantly for 30 seconds. Then pour the chopped tomatoes, oregano, salt, sugar and cook over medium heat for heat for 3 minutes. And finally, add the basil and simmer for 8-10 minutes. Remove form the heat and set aside. The sauce can be made a day ahead of baking your pizzas and you can also freeze it up to a month. I top my pizzas with mo more than 3 tablespoons of sauce.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flours and salt.</li>
            <li>In a small mixing bowl, stir together 200 grams ( a little less than a cup) lukewarm tap water, the yeast and the olive oil, then pour it into the flour mixture. knead with your hands until combined, approximately 3 minutes. Let the mixture rest in the bowl (covered by a tea towel) for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Knead the rested dough for 3 minutes, cut into 2 equal pieces and shape each into a ball. Place on a heavily floured surface, cover with a dampened cloth and let rest for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature, or 8 to 24 hours in the refrigerator. If you refrigerate the dough, remove it 30 to 45 minutes before begin to shape it for pizza.</li>
            <li>To make pizza, place each dough ball on a heavily floured surface and use for fingers to stretch it, then your hands to shape it into rounds. Top with sauce and toppings. Transfer to the pre heated oven and bake for 4 to 5 minutes. Remember to pre-heat the oven to its highest temperature, with the baking steel on the lowest rack for an hour before baking the pizzas.</li>
