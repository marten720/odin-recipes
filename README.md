I am learning how to properly formal text in html. I have learned about the
headers and body paragraphs that one can use. I also now know how to add links
and images to my website. File management is also something that I know how to
deal with in my repository. Then, I learned about both ordered and unordered
lists. I know how to make text bold or italic. I learned about different image
formats and what they're useful for.
